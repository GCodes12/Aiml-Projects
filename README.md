🌟 Oasis Infobyte Internship Projects (Data Science & Machine Learning)
Welcome to my repository showcasing the three machine learning projects I developed during my Oasis Infobyte Internship.
Each project demonstrates the complete ML pipeline — from data preprocessing and visualization to model training, evaluation, and deployment-ready prediction.

📘 Overview
This repository contains three projects:

No.	Project Title	Domain	Algorithm Used	Accuracy
1️⃣	Iris Flower Classification	Supervised Learning	Logistic Regression	95%
2️⃣	Car Price Prediction	Regression	Random Forest Regressor	R² = 0.92
3️⃣	Spam Mail Classification	Natural Language Processing	Linear SVM	97%
🧠 Tech Stack
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
Techniques: Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation, Hyperparameter Tuning, TF-IDF Vectorization
1️⃣ Iris Flower Classification
🌸 Description
A simple classification project that predicts the type of Iris flower — Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica — based on sepal and petal dimensions.

⚙️ Workflow
Load and explore the Iris dataset
Perform visualization and statistical analysis
Train model using Logistic Regression
Evaluate accuracy and test with new samples
📊 Result
Accuracy: 95.8%
Model: Logistic Regression
2️⃣ Car Price Prediction
🚗 Description
A machine learning model that predicts the selling price of used cars using features like present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, and transmission.

⚙️ Workflow
Data cleaning, visualization, and encoding
Compared multiple regression algorithms
Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
Selected best-performing Random Forest Regressor
📊 Result
Best Model: Random Forest
R² Score: 0.92
3️⃣ Spam Mail Classification
📩 Description
A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that classifies SMS messages as Spam or Ham using text-based features and machine learning.

⚙️ Workflow
Preprocessed text data (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
Converted messages into TF-IDF feature vectors
Compared multiple models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.
Selected Linear SVM as best model for classification
📊 Result
Accuracy: 97%
Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score
🧩 Conclusion
Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience in:

Data preprocessing and visualization
Building and tuning ML models
Applying NLP techniques for text classification
Interpreting results and presenting findings effectively
